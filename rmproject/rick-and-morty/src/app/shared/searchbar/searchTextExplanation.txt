Complete Data Flow Explanation

Let me explain the complete data flow with the fixed code:

SearchbarComponent:

User types in the search bar and clicks search or triggers the search event
onSearch() method calls this.searchText.emit(this.searchValue)
This emits the search text value up to the parent component


AppComponent:

Listens for the searchText event from SearchbarComponent via (searchText)="onSearchText($event)"
When received, calls onSearchText(searchText) which sets this._filterService.searchText = searchText
This triggers the setter in FilterService


FilterService:

The setter method takes the string value and calls this._searchText.next(value)
This pushes the new value to all subscribers of the searchText$ observable


CharactersComponent:

Subscribes to this._filterService.searchText$ in its constructor
When a new value is pushed through the Subject, the subscription callback executes
console.log(value) is called with the search text
